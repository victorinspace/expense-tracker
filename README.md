## Summary
With this project, I learned a lot more about  using HTML tables and gained more experience interacting with user data. I also gained more understanding of the power of HTML input elements.

I tried to practice more modern ES6 features and syntax as well and basically just did my best to keep my code as clean as possible while still mainting functionality. 

I would like to come back to this project to improve the UI, give the user more feedback and have the data be easier to manage in the backend.
